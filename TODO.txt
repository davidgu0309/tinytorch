Basic things:
  - rewrite tests with testing framework
  - implement tests for the many small things that are not covered by the tests yet
  - write some more serious matmul tests, including higher dimensional ones
  - implement e_k, eye and randomly initialized (at least uniform and normal) tensors
  - clean up documentation
  - implementa scalar * tensor ops and maybe more generic broadcasting
  - implement softmax and cross-entropy
  - include time and space complexities in documentation
  - improve makefile (variables for stuff etc.)
  - don't copy tensors all the time in computational DAG evaluation
  - make struct for tensor operations without parameters
  - pass tensor operation via template

Other tensor things we could do (not too important for now):
  - transposition
  - views
  - slicing
  - generic broadcasting
  - support removals from computational graph

Layers and Model:
  - implement activation layers
  - implement fully-connected layers
  - implement forward pass

Gradients:
  - think about how we should do this

Optimizers:
  - we are not there yet ...
