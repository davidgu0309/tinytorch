Basic things:
  - clean up tests (split framework from tests, maybe put different test suites in different files)
  - implement tests for the many small things that are not covered by the tests yet
  - write some more serious matmul tests, including higher dimensional ones
  - implement e_k, eye and randomly initialized (at least uniform and normal) tensors
  - update Doxyfile and Doxygen document all the headers
  - implementa scalar * tensor ops and maybe more generic broadcasting
  - implement softmax and cross-entropy
  - maybe set up GitHub actions for automated testing
  - make size a field

Other tensor things we could do (not too important for now):
  - transposition
  - views
  - slicing
  - generic broadcasting

Layers and Model:
  - implement activation layers
  - implement fully-connected layers
  - implement forward pass

Gradients:
  - think about how we should do this

Optimizers:
  - we are not there yet ...
