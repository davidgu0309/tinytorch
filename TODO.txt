Features:
  - implement softmax and cross-entropy
  - make struct for tensor operations without parameters
  - improve makefile (variables for stuff etc.)
  - implement high-level interface for common models
  - implement optimizers

Optimizations:
  - don't copy tensors all the time in DAG evaluation and tensor operation

Tensors:
  - implement zero and one for T
  - implement e_k, eye and randomly initialized (at least uniform and normal) tensors
  - implementa scalar * tensor ops
  - transposition
  - views
  - slicing
  - generic broadcasting
  - optimize

Tests:
  - rewrite tests with testing framework
  - implement tests for the many small things that are not covered by the tests yet
  - improve testing framework
    - epsilon comparisons
    - fail and not fail
    - logging

Documentation:
  - readme
  - doxygen main page
  - clean up documentation
  - include time and space complexities in documentation

Graph:
  - support removals from computational graph

Other:
  - design better directory structure for all repos
    - include should contain only the interface exposed to the user
